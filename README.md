# Point-Click-RPG-Sample
By using coordinates automatically generated, the goal is to allow the player to click to interact.
It's merely the bare bones of a project that I am gradually working on into turning into a more full game.

So far you are able to move to specific coordinates(hypothetically) and attack one of the 3 monsters spawned on specific coordinates.
